   title: Big Data Analytics for Research Libraries and Archives
   abstract: >
       Research libraries and archives have played a longstanding role in
       information management and access. In the second half of the twentieth
       century, libraries were at the forefront of automation and networked
       access to information. Since the advent of the internet, however, they
       have failed to keep pace with technological advances and currently face
       serious challenges in serving the evolving needs of researchers, whose
       information-seeking strategies are now shaped by internet search engines
       and online social media applications. To remain relevant in the current
       information landscape, libraries and archives must implement new
       strategies for converting legacy metadata to new formats that can add
       value to the research process. Although the data and metadata produced by
       libraries and archives may not always qualify, prima facie, as
       big data, an awareness among information professionals of the tools,
       techniques, and affordances of big data can help make library services
       more relevant to researchers.
