   title: Big data analytics for archives and research libraries
   abstract: Archives and research libraries are currently searching for technical solutions to migrate their catalogs and databases from legacy formats to Linked Open Data, using the W3C Resource Description Framework (RDF) standard. How can the tools of big data analytics be used to enable this transition? The problem of entity resolution and name disambiguation will be examined in particular.

   title: Big data on the blockchain? Distributed networks and large-scale analytics
   abstract: Massive distributed systems such as IPFS, BigchainDB, and Ethereum have been designed with the intention of reengineering the architecture of online information systems and eliminating exposure to centralized points of failure. Can these systems also support big data analytics and high-performance computing?
