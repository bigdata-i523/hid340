        Research libraries and archives have played a longstanding
        role in information management and access. In the second half
        of the twentieth century, libraries were at the forefront of
        automation and networked access to information. Since the
        advent of the internet, however, they have failed to keep pace
        with technological advances and currently face serious
        challenges in serving the evolving needs of researchers, whose
        information-seeking strategies are now shaped by internet
        search engines and online social media applications. To remain
        relevant in the current information landscape, libraries and
        archives must implement new strategies for converting legacy
        metadata to new formats that can add value to the research
        process. Although the data and metadata produced by libraries
        and archives may not always qualify, prima facie, as big data,
        an awareness among information professionals of the tools,
        techniques, and affordances of big data can help make library
        services more relevant to researchers.

        Massive distributed systems such as IPFS, BigchainDB, and
        Ethereum have been designed with the intention of
        reengineering the architecture of online information systems
        and eliminating exposure to centralized points of failure. Can
        these systems also support big data analytics and
        high-performance computing?
