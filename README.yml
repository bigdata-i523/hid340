        Research libraries and archives have played a longstanding
        role in information management and access. In the second half
        of the twentieth century, libraries were at the forefront of
        automation and networked access to information. Since the
        advent of the internet, however, they have failed to keep pace
        with technological advances and currently face serious
        challenges in serving the evolving needs of researchers, whose
        information-seeking strategies are now shaped by internet
        search engines and online social media applications. To remain
        relevant in the current information landscape, libraries and
        archives must implement new strategies for converting legacy
        metadata to new formats that can add value to the research
        process. Although the data and metadata produced by libraries
        and archives may not always qualify, prima facie, as big data,
        an awareness among information professionals of the tools,
        techniques, and affordances of big data can help make library
        services more relevant to researchers.

        Decentralized systems such as Bitcoin, the Interplanetary File
        System (IPFS), and Ethereum have been designed with the 
        intention of reengineering the architecture of online 
        information systems, minimizing exposure to centralized points 
        of failure, and creating new social models for the exchange of 
        data--which is posited as a valuable asset in and of itself. 
        Can these kinds of systems also support big data analytics and 
        processing? If so, what stands to be gained by taking a 
        blockchain-based approach to big data? Efforts to integrate 
        blockchains into big data pipelines must address the 
        inevitable tradeoffs between security and scalability. 
        BigchainDB is a new decentralized database framework that adds 
        blockchain-based features, such as immutability and asset 
        management, to traditional NoSQL distributed databases. 
        Although it is still in the early stages of development, 
        BigchainDB promises to make a significant contribution to the 
        ways in which data is shared and managed at scale.
